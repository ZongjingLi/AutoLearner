To generate questions and answers based on the images, please run
```
python generate_questions.py --input_scene_dir $INPUT_SCENE_DIR --output_dir $OUTPUT_QUESTION_DIR --output_questions_file $OUTPUT_FILE
```

Specifically, $INPUT_SCENE_DIR contains all the scene annotations files generated by the image generation engine, and the $OUTPUT_QUESTION_DIR is where you want to put the questions.
